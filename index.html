        <br /><b>JOEL MILLER</b>, is one of the central characters in The Last
        of Us,<br /><br />
        known for his complex and morally grey personality. A survivor of a
        devastating fungal outbreak, Joel is a hardened, resourceful,<br /><br />
        and skilled fighter who has endured great personal loss, including the
        tragic death of his daughter, Sarah. This trauma shapes his cold and
        distant demeanor, making him wary of forming emotional bonds.
        However,<br />
        when he's tasked with protecting a young girl named Ellie, Joel's
        fatherly instincts gradually re-emerge. Over time, he develops a deep,
        protective bond with Ellie, ultimately seeing her as a surrogate
        daughter.<br /><br />Joel's actions, especially his controversial
        decisions to keep Ellie safe at all costs,<br />
        highlight his struggle between self-preservation and love, making him
        one of the most compelling and conflicted characters in modern video
        games.<br /><br />

        <br /><b>ELLIE</b> is a key character in The Last of Us,<br /><br />
        known for her resilience, wit, and fierce determination. Born after the
        outbreak, Ellie has never known the world as it once was, but she
        possesses an inner strength that belies her young age.<br /><br />
        Despite the horrors she has witnessed, Ellie retains a sense of hope and
        curiosity, often displaying a sharp sense of humor and a love for comic
        books and music.<br /><br />
        What makes her truly remarkable is her immunity to the fungal infection
        that has decimated humanity, making her a symbol of hope for a possible
        cure. Throughout her journey with Joel, Ellie forms a deep emotional
        bond with him, viewing him as a father figure. However, her experiences
        also harden her, as she faces unimaginable losses and moral dilemmas.<br /><br />
        Ellieâ€™s character development, from an innocent child to a hardened
        survivor, makes her one of the most memorable and emotionally complex
        characters in gaming history.<br><br>
